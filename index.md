### Rating Icons: Are the big names worth the hype?

To understand the impact of a famous cast, we first need to define what is fame. We will consider the fame of an actor as the % of people that know the actor. Certainly, fame is subjective and context-dependent, and as much we would like to be omnipresent, our analysis will be confined to examining fame within the context of the United States of America. Now that we have our raw data, we need to take a second decision, when is someone famous? In our analysis, we will consider an actor famous only if half the US population knows him/her. Last, we need to estimate the fame of a cast ensemble, for this we will average the fame of the actors by the size of the cast. Once our measures established, we obtain the following 2 metrics per movie, the average fame of a cast, and it's famous to actor ratio (what % of the cast is famous). We find ourselves with a quantitative and a qualitative gauge for fame, now let’s see if all this reach is worth what they say.

#### Fame: evolution over time

As the data we have for fame levels is actual, more recent casts should be more likely to be famous, so one could say that analysing the impact of fame wouldn’t make sense. Yet recent movies have not better ratings than old movies, we can clearly see a downward trend in average ratings over time. Not only that, but average cast fame is fairly stable after 1930’s, which let us conclude that we can interpret the effect of the fame of different casts during different periods similarly.

## Financial analysis
Our focus is typically on ratings as the primary metric, but isn't the financial aspect of the movie industry just as fascinating? Is there a direct connection between movie ratings and their financial success? And do you think the fame of an actor could sway a movie's revenue potential? Let's dive in and find out!

### Inital Exploration

We started by merging the ADA movies dataset with our budget data, resulting in a curated collection of films where each entry is equipped with both revenue and budget data. These figures were then adjusted for inflation using our CPI data, ensuring that the temporal factors within the dataset are accounted for.

Upon examining the distribution of our data over the years, which movies surprise you the most when looking at their rating or revenue?

### Correlation & Regression Analysis
Diving into the analysis, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.23622 indicates a slight positive correlation between higher ratings and increased revenues. Moreover, employing linear regression to model the relationship between ratings (as the independent variable) and revenues (as the dependent variable) yields a coefficient of 7e07. This suggests that, on average, each additional rating point could mean an approximate $70,000,000 increase in movie revenue.

Incorporating the budget as an independent variable confirms that ratings are the dominant predictor, maintaining the established relationship with revenue.

### Quartiles Analysis
When we segment the data into rating quartiles—specifically, 5.9 (25th percentile), 6.5 (50th percentile), and 7.1 (75th percentile)—the trend persists: movies with higher ratings tend to generate higher revenues.

### Checking causation
To distinguish causation from mere correlation between ratings and revenues, we calculated the propensity score for each movie, considering budget and year as potential confounders. We set the threshold for a high rating at the 50th percentile, classifying ratings above 6.5 as 'high'. This categorization yielded two groups for comparison: the treated (high rating) and the control (low rating). After pair matching based on the propensity score, the average revenues of the treatment group and the control group stood at 219,224,169.79 and 106,129,755.70. This underscores that movies with higher ratings typically garner higher revenues.

In the next graphic we visualize the average revenue of both groups, alongside their respective 95% confidence intervals.

Afterwards, to see if there is a meaningful difference betwenn the two, a T-test is conducted to ascertain the statistical significance of the revenue differences between the treatment and control groups. The results confirm the significance of the disparity. Additionally, when observing the difference between the treatment and control groups over the years, we found that movies in the treatment group outperformed those in the control group revenue-wise in 93% of the years. Have a look below to see how treatment and control group revenues change over the years!

### Results of financial analysis

Finalizing our financial analysis, the data presents compelling evidence that creating a movie with favorable ratings is not only artistically gratifying but is also highly likely to succeed financially, providing great rewards for the cast and directors involved.
